# MIFIR Market-Entry Positioning Content

## Completed Components & Content

### 1. **Hero Section** ([app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx) & [components/home/HeroSection.tsx](components/home/HeroSection.tsx))
**Sharp Hero Positioning Statement:**
> "Ranking Institutions by Future Capability, Not Past Reputation"

**Key Message:**
MIFIR measures what institutions are committing resources to, what they are building systems for, and whether they are prepared to educate for a future none of us can predict. Evidence-based. Future-oriented. Reform-driven.

**Value Proposition Elements:**
- Global Launch 2025 – Built for the 2030–2040 Reality
- Governance & Future-Readiness (not vision documents, actual budgets)
- Innovation Depth (learning from failure, not just success)
- Technology Integration (embedded in curriculum, not showrooms)
- Ethical Leadership (action on commitments, not intent)

### 2. **Crisis/Problem Section** ([components/home/CrisisSection.tsx](components/home/CrisisSection.tsx))
**Why Traditional Rankings Fail the Future:**

Four core problems MIFIR addresses:
1. **Legacy Metrics Don't Predict Future Capability** - Historical reputation tells us nothing about 2035 readiness
2. **Optics Over Outcomes** - Glossy reports distract from genuine reform
3. **Ranking Manipulation as Strategy** - Gaming metrics instead of investing in quality
4. **No Signal for Risk-Taking or Innovation** - Systems penalize exactly what the future demands

**Key Quote:**
> "Reputation measures the past. MIFIR measures readiness for the future no one can predict."
