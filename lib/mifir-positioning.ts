  // Hero Statement (2-3 lines)
  heroStatement: "Ranking Institutions by Future Capability, Not Past Reputation",
  
  heroSubtext: "MIFIR measures what institutions are committing resources to, what they are building systems for, and whether they are prepared to educate for a future none of us can predict.",

  // Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
  elevatorPitch: "MIFIR is a next-generation global ranking framework that evaluates universities on future-readiness, innovation depth, governance maturity, technology integration, ethical leadership, and societal impact—not legacy metrics like reputation or publication volume.",

  valueProposition: {
    what: "A forward-looking institutional intelligence & ranking system",
    how: "Evidence-based, commitment-driven, and future-oriented",
    why: "Built for institutions preparing for 2030–2040 realities"
